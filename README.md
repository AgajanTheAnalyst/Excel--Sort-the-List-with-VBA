# In this project I did some coding in Excel VBA to have a list of sorts to pick
## Firstly let's have a look at the list

## This is the VBA coding that I used to bring the macros together to make a list of sorts!
### 1 I created variable promtmsg as string to write my message and list
### 2 Then created variable sortorder to put promtmsg into a InputBox
### 3 Lastly created if statement to enable macros in a given number

## Next task was inserting a button for created macros.

## Lastly this is the list that appears when you click on the button
### As a result It will sort the list according to a number you press to
